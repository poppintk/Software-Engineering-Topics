253. Meeting Rooms II

class Solution {

        if(intervals.length == 0 || intervals[0].length == 0) return 0;

        int result = 0;
        
        for(int[] m : intervals){
            minHeap.add(m);
            // condition for when we should remove a meeting room out of priority queue
             while(!minHeap.isEmpty() && minHeap.peek()[1] <= m[0]){
                minHeap.poll();

1. Two Sum
        167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted (two pointers)
        1099. Two Sum Less Than K(two pointers, modified from  Two Sum II)

15. 3Sum
This problem is a follow-up of Two Sum, and it is a good idea to first take a look at Two Sum and Two Sum II - Input Array is Sorted.
Note: if we going to use O(n^2) approch then we need to sort the array then use two pointers
