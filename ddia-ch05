Distributed Data

Shared-nothing architecture == horizontal scale == scale out

Replica VS Partitioning

Purpose of replica
1) geographcally distributed(close to user and reduce latency)
2) one service down and no impact to entire system
3) allowing scale out read and increase throughput


three popular replication algorithm:
1) single leader
2) multi-leader
3) leader less

things need to consider:
1) sync vs async
2) how to deal with failure in repica

leader-base replication OR master/slave replication
