Find(x): find the root/cluster-id of x 
Union(x,y): merge two clusters


Usage:
Check whether two elements are in the same set or not in O(1)

Complexity:
Find: O(a(n)) = O(1)
Union: O(a(n)) = O(1)
Space: O(n)

Without optimization: Find: O(n)

Two key optimizations:
1) Path compression: make tree flat
2) Union by rank: merge low rank tree to high rank one
