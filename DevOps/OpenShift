Management Tools
  - Web Console
  - CLI
  - Restful API

Projects & Users
  - Project build on top of K8S namespace and all projects are isolated
  - Openshift uses OAuth server to "Allow All" by default 
    - configured by "etc/openshift/master/master-config.yaml"
  - Users
    - Regular user - developer
    - System - system:admin system:master
    - Service - system:serviceaccount:proj1:db_user
    
 - commands 
   oc get projects
   oc get users
   
   
SCM, Builds and Deployments in OPENSHIFT
  - Openshift will do following work automatically, no additional configuration is needed
  Build
    - Create build (given git url) -> Download Source -> Build Image -> Push to Docker Registry -> 
  Deployment
    - Deploy image from Docker Registry to K8S cluster (Note that Openshift yaml format is different from K8S)
    
  
  Build
    Source: git repo url
    Build Strategy
      1) Dokcer Build use Dockerfile, if this strategy is chosen then it requires Dockerfile in the project repo 
      2) Source-To-Image(S2I)
      3) Custom Strategy
    Output to image registry
      Image Streams: resolves issue that third party docker registry have updated lastest version
      
    TriggerBuild
      - above configurations are for manually process
      - trigger will be execute at the time that events(Could be push changes to codebase) take place by using Repo "WebHooks"(A http request to request a task to run)
