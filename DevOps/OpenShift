SCM, Builds and Deployments in OPENSHIFT
  - Openshift will do following work automatically, no additional configuration is needed
  Build
    - Create build (given git url) -> Download Source -> Build Image -> Push to Docker Registry -> 
  Deployment
    - Deploy image from Docker Registry to K8S cluster (Note that Openshift yaml format is different from K8S)
