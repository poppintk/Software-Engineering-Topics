Architecture: Single master, master slave

Components:
  Master:
    1) Kube-api server:
      - the entrance for external system to interact with K8S
      - provide authentication, authorization, access control and API register and discovery
    
    2) etcd
      - key value based database for K8S as all data cluster backend database
      - K8S cluster etcd database usually need a backup plan 
    
    3) Kube-scheduler
      - monitoring those newly created Pods and manage to schedule nodes to run Pods
      - it must use master to schedule all K8S cluster operations
    
    4) Kube-controller-manager
        a) Node Contorller: response and alert issues on the nodes
        b) Replication Controller: used for every replication controller to maintain correct number of Pods
        c) Endpoints Controller: used for adding endpoints(server or Pod)
        d) Service Account & Token Controllers: create default account and API token for the new naming space
