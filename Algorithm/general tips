Note1: difference property: rightIndex - leftIndex = diffIndex,
this diffIndex is 1 based(start from 1...)
if we want to get length = diffIndex + 1
if left and right are not index base, left - right = diff
if we want to get length = diff + 1
length => 1 based 

rightindex - leftindex + 1 = length;
RightIndex = leftIndex - 1 + lenghth;
