Clairify:
    1) clairify Function Sinature. 
        - function input
        - function output
        - input is null or empty
    2) Abitrary word
        LinkedList
            - single LinkedList/double LinkedList
            - contains Cycle?
        Tree:
            - Binary Tree? BST ? N-narry Tree
            - Does node contains pointer to parent
        Node:
            - what data type in the Node
            
        Sorted: descending/ascending order
        Reverse: from the head to tail or partially reverse
        same/Equal: value same or reference same
        Content Same/Equal: 
            1) case sensitive: ABC = abc
            2) ordering: abc = cba
            3) space: one space = two space
            4) duplicate: ab = aabb

Note1: difference property: rightIndex - leftIndex = diffIndex,
this diffIndex is 1 based(start from 1...)
if we want to get length = diffIndex + 1
if left and right are not index base, left - right = diff
if we want to get length = diff + 1
length => 1 based 

rightindex - leftindex + 1 = length;
RightIndex = leftIndex - 1 + lenghth;

TwoD array's coordination into oneD array : k = i * cols + j
OneD to twoD: k % cols = j, k / cols = i

BFS use Map<?,Integer> distance = new HashMap<>();
Better
