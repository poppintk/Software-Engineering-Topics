Dijkstra Shortest path is one of Greedy Algorithm
Greedy Algorithm Runtime analysis differs in case by case.
For Graph problem usually can use this pattern to start analyze the runtime:
- total runtime of Vertex + total runtime of Edges
- usually greedy algorithm will use of data structure Heap, we can study how data add to heap and remove from heap to help calculate runtime

complexity runtime analysis:
  - total runtime for Vertice's
  - total runtime for Edges
  - base on different implementation of Heap, runtime differs
