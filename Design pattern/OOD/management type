Clarify
  What: for management type first asking question from administrator perspective, 
  like what are target we're going to manage? (This is way to get input/output for management type question)
  e.g. 
  parking lot system -> parking lot AND vehicle (vehicle<input> -> Parking lot System -> target parking lot<output>)
  Restaurant system -> Party/Table (request<input> -> Restaurant system -> Party/Table<output>)

  How: for management type, following below pattern
    Reserve
    Service
    Payment
  
Core object
  consider input and output of xxx management system
  Note: when define classes mapping, one best practice to follow is that 
  try to avoid inject a Moving object inside a Static object. but how to describe relation between static object and moving object?
  using the receipt class!
  
Use case
  Draw UML http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~cs3443/uml/uml.html
  how to start going through each core object and figure out the use case?
  we follow this pattern for management type OOD
    - Reserve
    - Serve (how to serve request)
    - Checkout 

Class
  for management type OOD we should keep this in mind that using receipt Class to keep information
  e.g. Library System 
    No: User  -----> Book 
    Better: User ----> Receipt(describe relation between user and book, like DB table many to many relation) ------> Book
  

 
Design pattern
  Parking Lot
    Singleton -> Parking system only have one parkingLot(Singleton)
