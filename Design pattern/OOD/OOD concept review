The main foucs of OOD is having Viable solution - Viability

NOs:
  1) base on personal assumption/understanding about the system and judge how the system should be (Should communicate first)
  2) Assuming question is OOD or SD or Algorithm (Should ask clairfication quesiton)
  3) Oh, wait a second, I think I can optimize the process by modifying/removing this class
  4) Did not test your test case whether your solution is viable
  
S.O.L.I.D

Single Responsibility principle: A class should only have one reason to change it OR a class should only serve one duty
            e.g.
              public class AreaCalculator {
                private float result;
                public float calculateArea(Shape s) {}
                public String printAreaAccurateToOneDecimalPlace() {} // AreaCalculator shouldn't carry print responsibility
              }

Open close principle: Open to extension, close to modification
            e.g.
              public class AreaCalculator {
                public float calculateArea(Triangle t) {} // many same method with different input parameters
                public float calculateArea(Rectangle r) {}
              }
              
              Better:
              public class AreaCalculator {
                public float calculateArea(Shape s) {}
              }
    
    
    
Liskov substitution principle: any children class should be able to substitute its base class or parent class(focus on the class behaviour, e.g. methods or attributes)
            e.g.
              public class Shape {
                abstract public float calculateVolumn();
                abstract public float calculateArea();
              }
    
              public class Rectangle extends Shape {} // Rectangle doesn't have Volumn, Note: behaviour of Rectangle class is not same as Shape here
              public class Cube extends Shape {}
    
Interface segregation principle: any class should not force it to implement a interface that it never used
            e.g.
              public interface Shape {
                public float calculateVolumn();
                public float calculateArea();
              }

              public class Rectangle implements Shape {} // Rectangle doesn't have Volumn, Note: Rectangle also override the calculateVolumn() method
              public class Cube implements Shape {}
    
 Dependency inversion principle: abstraction should not rely on concrete implementation, and concrete implementation should reply on abstraction.
  concrete class should implement interface or abstracted class AND all those details implementation be addressed inside the each concrete class
            e.g.
              public class AreaCalculator {
                private float result;
                public float getResult() {return this.result;}
                public float calculateArea(Shape s) {
                  if (s == Triangle) {this.result = b*h / 2;}
                  else if (s == Rectangle) {this.result = l * w;}
                }
              }

              Better:
              public class AreaCalculator {
                private float result;
                public float getResult() {return this.result;}
                public float calculateArea(Shape s) {
                  s.calculateArea(); // all detail implementation is inside the each concrete class and each class implement Shape
                }
              }

 Access modifier in UML
 package: only avaialbe in same package
 public: +
 private: -
 protected: # also accessiable by its children class  
 
 When we have function return void, How do we determine the running state? e.g. how to know your program run successfully? like having some feedback?
 Exception: note that, Exception handling is better than using the status code in OOD 
 
 5C's Approach
 Clarify - communicate with peers and ensure the scope of the question is asking about and also to avoid ambiguous
    What - using noun to derive it's attributes
    How - asking potential rules. e.g. throw your naive solution and see the feedback
    Who - optional
    
 Core Objects - define relevant classes and class relationship(mapping relation)
    1) base on the target system thinking about its input/output
    2) base on the core object and linearly determine its relevant classes
    
 Cases - define all scenarios/use cases(features)
    This is where state the use cases of system that you and your peer agrees on, should state all use cases for you to figure out solution and 
    also it is helpful for you later on to verify it
    How to derive use class?
    go through each of core objects determine the use cases.
    end of this session, asking your peer. those are the usu cases I have so far, do I miss anything?
 
 Classes - use UML diagram to fill in the methods or attributes of each class
    draw UML diagram
    Why? Minimal Viable Product
    How? go through all use cases 
 
 Correctness - check design and verify it's viable solution
    validate use cases
    follow good practice
    S.O.L.I.D
    Design pattern
