1. When a user clicks the “Buy” button, a payment event is generated and sent to the payment service.

2. The payment service stores the payment event in the database.

3. Sometimes a single payment event may contain several payment orders. For example, you may select products from multiple sellers in a single checkout process. The payment service will call the payment executor for each payment order.

4. The payment executor stores the payment order in the database.

5. The payment executor calls an external PSP to finish the credit card payment.
  1) call PSP create payment with nouce(UUID, payment_order_id for "exactly once" registration),This registration request contains payment information like amount, currency, expireation data.
    Note: no seller account(target account) is needed here, because we know seller now is company account(transfer money from buyer to company account)
    
  2) return payment token(UUID from PSP that uniquely identifies the payment registration, we can examine the payment registration and the payment execution status later using this token)
  3) payment service stores the token in the database 
  4) calling the PSP-hosted payment page -> display a PSP-hosed payment page with the token from step 3 and redirect URL, PSP's javascript code will use this token to get detail information like how much money going to collect from buyer)
  5) Asynchronously, PSP calls payment service with payment status via a webhook. The webhook is an URL on the payment system side that was registered with PSP during the initial setup with PSP.
  afterwards, payment system update pyment_order_status in database. 

6. After the payment executor has successfully executed the payment, the payment service will update the wallet to record how much money a given seller has.

7. The wallet server stores the updated balance information in the database.

8. After the wallet service has successfully updated the seller’s balance information, the payment service will call the ledger to update it.

9. The ledger service appends the new ledger information to the database.

10. Every night the PSP or banks send settlement files to their clients. The settlement file contains the balance of the bank account, together with all the transactions that took place on this bank account during the day. 



If you plan to accept credit card payments online, you’ll likely need both a payment gateway and a payment processor.
