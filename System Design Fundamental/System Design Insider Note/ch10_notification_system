Step 1 - Understand the problem and establish design scope
  Candidate: What types of notifications does the system support? Interviewer: Push notification, SMS message, and email.
  Candidate: Is it a real-time system?
  Interviewer: Let us say it is a soft real-time system. We want a user to receive notifications as soon as possible. However, if the system is under a high workload, a slight delay is acceptable.
  Candidate: What are the supported devices?
  Interviewer: iOS devices, android devices, and laptop/desktop.
  Candidate: What triggers notifications?
  Interviewer: Notifications can be triggered by client applications. They can also be scheduled on the server-side.
  Candidate: Will users be able to opt-out?
  Interviewer: Yes, users who choose to opt-out will no longer receive notifications.
  Candidate: How many notifications are sent out each day?
  Interviewer: 10 million mobile push notifications, 1 million SMS messages, and 5 million emails.
