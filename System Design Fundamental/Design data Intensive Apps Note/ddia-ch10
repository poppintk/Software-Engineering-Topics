Batch System/Distributed Computing


Online System
  - like Database, Cache, Search Index and Web Server
  - measurement metrics, response time
  
Batch System (offline system) 
  - input large number of data and run a job to process it and output some data. it usually takes couple mins up to couple days. No user will wait for job done, usually run on scheduled time
  - measurement metrics, throughput
  
Streaming System(Real time system)
  - A system between Online system and Batch system
  
  
MapReduce
  Note: MapReduce base on File System, like its input file and output file all in the GFS/HDFS. no necessary to save mapped local disk in GFS/HDFS, 
  if it is missing due to failure then re-mapping
