Batch System/Distributed Computing


Online System
  - like Database, Cache, Search Index and Web Server
  - measurement metrics, response time
  
Batch System (offline system) 
  - input large number of data and run a job to process it and output some data. it usually takes couple mins up to couple days. No user will wait for job done, usually run on scheduled time
  - measurement metrics, throughput
  
Streaming System(Real time system)
  - A system between Online system and Batch system
  
  
MapReduce
  Note: MapReduce base on File System, like its input file and output file all in the GFS/HDFS. no necessary to save mapped local disk in GFS/HDFS, 
  if it is missing due to failure then re-mapping
  
  - STEPS
    1) Input
    2) Split
    3) Map (coding part, input parameters: key content address, value is content)
    4) Transfer
      Master node will take care of Transfer, how?
        - each node running Map task will do partition sort(quick sort) on the mapped output and decide which Reducer that partiton chunks are sent to 
        - each node running Reducer task receives partition chunks and do k-way merge(merge partiton data into list for the same key) 
    5) Reduce (coding part, input parameters: key recieved from step 3, value is iterator or list for the same key)
    6) Output
    
    NOTE: is it the more Reducer the better? Ans: NO, The number of keys is maximum number of Reducer, beyond that it is wasted
