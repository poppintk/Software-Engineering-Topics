Partial Failure: in distributed system some part of system could run into issue or failure unexpected, but the rest of system is working fine.
Nonderterministic: unpredictable, not even sure whether request is sent through network

TCP/IP is not so reliable even though it hides package lost, duplicates and re-arrange pakcage slice but all those operations cause network delay.
TCP/IP only confirm that package is deliveried to machine, but on that machine there is no gurrantee that msg is processed by server applicaiton


Unreliable Network
  a) Request lost
    - Request lost(someone cut the network cable)
    - Request on queue (due to reciver on it's limit)
  b) remote server node unavaialbe
    - remote server node unavaialbe (shutdown or down)
    - remote server node temporary stop response(due to long time garbage collection)
  c)response lost
    - remote server node has process request but network reposne lost (maybe due to network Switch wrong configration)
    - remote server node has process request but response is develivery in a delay (network or your own machine at its limit)
  
  A solution to those issue is by using Timeout
  
  Timeout issue:
    1) timeout too soon, applicaiton process twice
    2) System is on its limit and one of node is temporary slow due to high traffic load, it will make situation worse. it will cause cascading failure(all nodes declaire that not available)
