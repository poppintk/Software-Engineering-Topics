Partition

Skew: unbalanced distributed data to each partition
Hot Spot: The hotest skew data

How to resolve above issue?
  - Randomization
    - when it comes to search, we don't know which partition the data is located, which end up global search all partitions
  - Parition base on key range
    
  - partition base on Hashcode
    Disadvantage: lost the efficency on range search, in case of range search, MongoDB will send to all partitions to get search result 
    Advantage: reduce the "Skew" and "Hot Spot" issue (NOTE: not completely resolve)
    what if we need range search? use Cassandra
