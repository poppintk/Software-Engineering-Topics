Message System : producer push messages and consumer receive messages

1) Producer publish messages faster than consumer can handle?
  a) messages are dropped, message lost
  b) message are cached on memory(backpressure) then persistence them into disk (it will slow down the throughput of message system)
  
2) if Message System is down
  a) persistence messages into disk


Consume Data from the queue
  a) load balance: rotate all consumers to consume data
  b) fan-out: the same message will broadcast to all its consumers
  
Prevent the data lost
  a) acknowledgement (RabbitMQ)
    as long as message is used by its consumer, then consumer will mannually ack the particular message, as the result the message will be deleted from the queue
    NOTE: this mechanism will break sequence that message consumed, due to the one of mesages is retry(unack due to exception)
    
    
Log-based message brokers: Kafka
Topic contains more of Partitions
partition has offset and consumer increment offset when data is consumed and producer append the data to the tail of each partition, offset are stored inside the consumer group
consumer group are group of consumer clients
