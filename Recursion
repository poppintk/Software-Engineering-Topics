1) 

assume recursion function is: recurse(object.next);

public ListNode recurse(ListNode head){
  if(head == null || head.next == null) return head;
  
  recurse(head.next.next); // base case is head == null or head.next == null
}

2) if recursion function return something, make sure someting is return follow the same sequence.
like, if returned is head then basecase and non-basecase part should be head. 
if returned is tail then basecase and non-basecase part should be tail.
think careful through how returned value connect to previous call stack.
