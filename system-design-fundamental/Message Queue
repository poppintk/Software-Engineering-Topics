Message Queue:
use case:
   1) asyc task
   2) decoupling between services
   3) controll the trafic on peak time, in order to protect downstream services
concepts:
   1) message broker
   2) destination
JMS(Java Message Service) Java base Message queue
- base on JVM message broker standard. ActiveMQ, HornetMQ are JMS implementation

AMQP(advanced Message Queuing Protocol)
- Advanced message queue protocol, JMS compatible
- RabbitMQ is AMQP implementation

RabbitMQ:
   Message:
      message body: not public accessible
      message head: routing-key, priority, delivery-mode(durable)
   Publisher:
      Message producer, send message to exchange of Message queue application
   Exchange:
      use for receiving producer's message and routing those message to correct queue
      4 types: direct(default), fanout, topic, and headers
   
   Queue:
      use for keeping message until messages are sent to consumer. A message can be sent to many queues.
      messages are waiting for consumer to take them away
  
   Binding:
      binding exchange and queue (can be many to many)
      
   Consumer
   
   Virtual host:
      represent whole bunch of exchanges, queue and binding with separant excution environment
   
   Broker:
      many of virtual host together
   
   Connection:
      in Rabbit Queue only on TCP connection is created
   
   Channel:
      use multiplexing bidirectional channel in the TCP connection. AMQP command is sent through channel, 
      Whatever publish, subscribe and receving messages all sent through channel.
      
      
      
      
## Reliable Message Queue
   in order to guarrantee message won't lose, we can use transaction, but throughput will be decreased by a factor of 250
   therefore we use confirm callback instead
   
   NOTE: reliable => need table to store message in the database with status(NOT SEND, SEND, QUEUED, CONSUMED) like a log
   then use callback to keep tracking status. if some message not deliver successful then required scheduler job to re-run.
   
   Producer   -------->   | Broker Exchange ----> Queue | ------>  Consumer

Producer ---> Broker (confirmCallback, triggered as long as broker receives, if cluster only triggers when all broker receive)
Exchange ---> Queue (returnCallback, triggered when message FAIL to deliver to the queue)
Queue ---> Consumer ack
