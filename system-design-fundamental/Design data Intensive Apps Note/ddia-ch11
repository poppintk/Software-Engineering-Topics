Message System
  use cases:
    - weather sensor peridically measurement
    - monitoring system 
    - user actions(order)

  Issues:
    1) if producer sending message faster than consumers can process?
      Solution:
        - drop message
        - put on the buffer queue
        - backpressure(flow control, blocking producer to send more of message)


    2) Node(MQ) is unavailble
        - durable write to disk or/and relicas
          traoff lower throughput and higher latency

  Note that, not all system requires reliable MQ, for example weather sensor measurement data is not so important for every data to be sent
