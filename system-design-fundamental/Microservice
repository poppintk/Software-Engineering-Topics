          entire website on the high peak, service pressure increase. base on the bussiness logic and traficc. now stop the service and return downgrade data to all callers. 


        Circut Breaker vs Downgrade
          same:
            - for availability and reliability, stoping the service
            - user eventually all see some part of feature unavailable
          difference:
            - Circuit breaker is callee on issue, then trigger base on the rule
            - downgrade for entire system concerns, stop some service to release resource
