Data inconsistant issue with local transactional rollback on Exception

Assume we have three service : A,B and C
their calling chain is A -> B -> C
example :
in A service 
processA() {
  doSomeWork();
  B();
  C();
}

1)
if call B() RPC fail we can throw Exception to trigger rollback,
but what if B() just network delay? in that case, if B has change someting in the DB and we rollback changes on A.
This will be issue. Because we expect all should rollback.

2) calling failed on C(), in such case B(0 will never rollback
